# Minipax

Minipax is a typeface inspired by the novel 1984, from George Orwell. It has been vaguely influenced by the skeleton of the font used in my edition of the book (printed in 84 !). But more importantly, it’s been designed to fit with the atmosphere of the Orwellian dystopia. And although Minipax remains a rather transparent text typeface, many of its distinctive features have been crafted to reflect de dusty and gritty universe of the novel.

There’s something more about Minipax : from the start, I wanted it to be a quite complete type family (large glyph sets are rare in the world of open-source fonts). Which is why it has many alternates, ligatures, special characters and a whole bunch of diacritics… So that you can enjoy typesetting with Minipax, without worrying about language support or small capitals for instance. This is also the reason why I made it a variable-font… hoping it would provide a reasonable amount of choices to a demanding typographer.

## Development

Minipax is planned to be a quite extensive type family, with an italic cut coming pretty soon and a monowidth version hopefully done by the end of the year 2019. In the meantime, have fun with the upstraight version.
